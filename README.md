# About `mini_qa`

`mini_qa` is a toy question-answering program.  It uses Google and
Wolfram Alpha to attempt to answer questions of the form "Who... ?"

An example question is: "Who discovered relativity?"

The design is inspired by the AskMSR system developed by researchers
at Microsoft Research.  The original paper is:

Brill, Lin, Banko, Dumais and Ng, "Data-Intensive Question
Answering" (2001).

I've described background to this program
[here](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-to-answer-a-question-a-simple-system/)
and
[here](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/using-evaluation-to-improve-our-question-answering-system/).

# Installation and useage

To be added.  Note that `mini_qa` was written with the `v0.01` version
of `ec2_tools` in mind:
[code available here](https://github.com/mnielsen/ec2_tools/tree/v0.01).

# Note on contributions and pull requests

I am no longer maintaining the code at all (2017).
